    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>This tool is for informational purposes only. It does not constitute legal advice and should not be used to definitively assess compliance. While I have strived to be accurate and precise in the information presented, I have also
    over-simplified the rules in many cases, in ways I believe are not critical for policymaking/analysis purposes, but could well be critical for actual compliance.</p>
